📖 Project Overview
This project is a simple image gallery built with React and Tailwind CSS. It showcases dog images in a clean, responsive layout while practicing key React concepts such as props and array mapping.

🚀 Tech Stack
- React – Component-based UI library
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework

⚙️ Key Features
- Reusable Components: Each dog image is rendered through a single component, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
- Props Usage: Data flows from parent to child components using props, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- Array Mapping: The gallery leverages the .map() function to dynamically render multiple dog image components from an array.
- Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS ensures the gallery adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

This project is part of my ongoing journey in learning React by building practical, hands‑on projects. Through this dog image gallery, I explored how props enable data flow between components and how array mapping makes it easy to render reusable components multiple times. Combined with Tailwind CSS for styling, the project helped me strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals while creating a clean and responsive UI.
